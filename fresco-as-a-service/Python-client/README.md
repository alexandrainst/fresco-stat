<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

FRESCO-stat is a library for secure numerical computations, statistics and
linear algebra using the <a href="https://github.com/aicis/fresco">FRESCO
framework</a>. FRESCO uses secure multi-party computation to enable
computations to be performed on data distributed among multiple parties
without each party seeing the other parties' data. 

The FRESCO-stat library is a Java library, but FRESCO-as-a-service enables it
to be used from other environments. This particular package allows it to be called 
from a Python environment.

## Install
Install the project using pip by executing:

```
pip install .
```

in the [Python-client](.) folder. The package may now be used by importing `stat` from the 
`faas` package.
